<p>Othmane Rahmani</p>
<p>I'm a aspiring data scientist and programmer. I learnt practically everything I know online, including English; I'm hooked with technology and enjoy learning about and being current with contemporary technologies. But I didn't limit myself to only this domain; I also have a bachelor's degree in linguistics, which helped me hone my language abilities and learn how to successfully utilize them to create stories and advertise items. In addition, I've worked as a translator and graphic designer on the side. Furthermore, I have worked in the restaurant business as well as construction. Doing these body-focused professions provided me with new perspectives and ideas that I could use to a variety of different disciplines.</p>
